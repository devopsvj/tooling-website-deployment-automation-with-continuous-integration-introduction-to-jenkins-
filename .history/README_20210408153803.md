# Tooling Website deployment automation with Continuous Integration. Introduction to Jenkins

In previous [Load Balancer Solution With Apache]() we introduced horizontal scalability concept, which allow us to add new Web Servers to our Tooling Website and you have successfully deployed a set up with 2 Web Servers and also a Load Balancer to distribute traffic between them. If it is just two or three servers - it is not a big deal to configure them manually. Imagine that you would need to repeat the same task over and over again adding dozens or even hundreds of servers.
